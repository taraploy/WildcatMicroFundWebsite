# WildcatMicroFundWebsite

# Purpose of website
Weber State University has a Microfund that can grant money to help entrepreneurs in need.
This website has been developed for the Microfund by various people to help lessen the burden
of the Admin for the Microfund.  They were originally using an Excel Spreadsheet to keep track
of the entrepreneurs, funds given out, etc. and it was a mess.  With the website we have tried
to streamline this process so the Admin doesn't have to manually enter anything.

# se of website
This website is strictly for use by the Wildcat Microfund of Weber State University, and anyone
involved in the process.  Entrepreneurs will have the ability to apply for grants through this 
website as long as they meet the criteria required by Wildcat Microfund.
